# Help me
Hi, I'am [Asthriona](https://Asthriona.com) Full time WoW player, and some kind of developper. i'm doing stuff on internet for quite a long time... a decade now, and I love making stuff that can be usefull or help other.  
But if you want to help me, Feel free to take a look at the code, Create issue for idea/bugs, or pull request.  
  
  As I said, i'm full time doing this, and now days, being indie developper don't really pay the bills (not even talking about server bill.), so if you really want to help, and have some bucks to spare, Feel free to pay me a ko-fi
